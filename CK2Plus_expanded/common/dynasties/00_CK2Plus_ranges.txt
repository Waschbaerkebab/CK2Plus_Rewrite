# Officially Reserved Dynasty Range 1.000.124.000 - 1.000.127.999
# Above was reserved for CK2+ in the very beginning, to ensure compatibility with other mods.
# However, that method is outdated since the dynasties are now in the "extended" submod, which by default is incompatible with other mods.
# So instead we will henceforth use a method that is easier to maintain for us.
# Below, you will find the ranges actually used by the mod, per culture.
